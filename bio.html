            <p>I am a high honors Physics graduate who combined studies with working and other commitments. In achieving this, I have shown myself to be self-motivated, committed, and determined in achieving my goals, come what may. I have also shown practical skills, a firm sense of responsibility, and my capacity to work hard under pressure. I possess excellent verbal and written communication skills and can relate to a wide range of people, as proven by my varied work experiences: in academic research, administrivia, laboratory classes, retail, and tutoring.</p>
            <p>After graduating I made it my goal to become a software engineer. Using my problem-solving skills and self-motivation from being a Physics graduate I am now learning technical skills like web foundations, building interactive websites, front-end development, back-end development, and full-stack development. With these skills I hope to build a portfolio site to showcase how much I learned.</p>
